# üö® IMPORTANT: Your Code is NOT on the Production Site Yet!

## The Current Situation

‚úÖ **What's Working:**
- Your local site has all the code from GitHub
- VS Code is connected and working with your local site
- The `or-travel-child` theme exists on your LOCAL site

‚ùå **The Problem:**
- The production site (https://orhorvitztravel.flywheelsites.com/) does NOT have your code yet
- The `or-travel-child` theme is NOT on the production server
- You need to UPLOAD the code to Flywheel

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Get Your Flywheel SFTP Credentials

1. Open your browser and go to: https://app.getflywheel.com/
2. Log in with your Flywheel account
3. Find and click on your site: **orhorvitztravel**
4. Click on **"Connect"** button
5. Click on **"SFTP"**
6. You'll see credentials like:
   - **Host:** something.flywheelsites.com
   - **Username:** your-username
   - **Password:** your-password
   - **Port:** 22

### Step 2: Download FileZilla (Free SFTP Client)

1. Go to: https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64
2. Download and install FileZilla Client

   - **Username:** (from Step 1)
   - **Password:** (from Step 1)
   - **Port:** 22
2. Click **"Quickconnect"**

### Step 4: Upload Your Theme and Plugins

**Navigate on the LEFT (local) side to:**
```
c:\Users\elshtotl\Local Sites\or-travel-local\app\public\wp-content
```

**Navigate on the RIGHT (server) side to:**
```
/wp-content
```

**Now upload these folders:**

1. **Upload the theme:**
   - From LEFT: `themes/or-travel-child/`
   - To RIGHT: `themes/` folder
   - Right-click on `or-travel-child` folder and select "Upload"

2. **Upload the Astra parent theme (if not already there):**
   - From LEFT: `themes/astra/`
   - To RIGHT: `themes/` folder
   - Right-click on `astra` folder and select "Upload"

3. **Upload the plugins:**
   - From LEFT: `plugins/or-agent-widget/`
   - To RIGHT: `plugins/` folder
   - Right-click and "Upload"
   
   - From LEFT: `plugins/or-site-setup/`
   - To RIGHT: `plugins/` folder
   - Right-click and "Upload"

### Step 5: Activate the Theme on Production

1. Go to: https://orhorvitztravel.flywheelsites.com/wp-admin
2. Log in with your WordPress admin credentials
3. Go to **Appearance ‚Üí Themes**
4. Find **"OR Travel Child"** theme
5. Click **"Activate"**

### Step 6: Activate the Plugins

1. Still in WordPress admin
2. Go to **Plugins**
3. Find and activate:
   - OR Agent Widget
   - OR Site Setup

### Step 7: Clear Cache

1. In Flywheel dashboard, find the cache settings
2. Clear all cache
3. Also clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

## ‚úÖ Success Check

After completing these steps:
- Visit https://orhorvitztravel.flywheelsites.com/
- You should see your `or-travel-child` theme active
- The site should look like your local version

## üîÑ Future Updates

Once this initial deployment is done, for future updates you can:
1. Make changes locally in VS Code
2. Commit and push to GitHub: `git add . && git commit -m "Update" && git push`
3. Use FileZilla to upload only the changed files to Flywheel

## Alternative: Automated Deployment

If you want automatic deployment (GitHub ‚Üí Flywheel), ask Flywheel support about:
- Git Push deployments
- Or setting up deployment keys
